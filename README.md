## Purpose:

Statistical analysis aims to prove the statistical significance of the conclusion from [GMV Signal Analysis](#resources) for stronger support of our theory. 

## Testing Groups - Hypothesis:
1. Income Level - The lower the median household income of the restaurant zip code, the higher the GMV from our clients.
2. Population Density - No correlation between population density and the GMV levels of our voice platform clients.
3. Region - Our client base (active + churned), average GMV per client, and ICP SAM all trend higher from the east towards the west.
4. School Zone Rating - The lower the client's zipcode's local school zone rating, the higher the average monthly GMV.
5. Cuisine - Chinese restaurants have higher GMV clients than Japanese/other cuisines by a significant margin.
6. Price Range - One-$ restaurants generate higher GMV for our business. Our product is disproportionately more receptive towards one-$ restaurants than two-$$ restaurants compared to total ICP SAM.
7. Restaurant First Seen Date (after 3/1/2020) - The longer a client's restaurant has been in business, the higher the average GMV that client tends to generate for us.
8. Reviews by Month - Restaurants with fewer monthly reviews generate higher GMV.
9. Average Review Score (all sources) - No identified correlation between restaurant review score and client GMV.
10. Vitality Score (online activeness) - Custom metric - Restaurants with higher Brizo's online Vitality Score have a slight but confident correlation to client GMV.
11. Reputation Score / Custom metric - Consistent with average restaurant rating, there is no correlation between reputation score and client GMV.

## Methods:
- ANOVA
- Linear Regression
